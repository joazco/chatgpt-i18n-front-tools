# chatgpt-i18n-front-tools

chatgpt-i18n-front-tools is a nifty tool that lets you translate, fix, or jazz up your JSON-formatted text, all by directly tapping into the power of ChatGPT.

This project is a fork of the [chatgpt-i18n](https://github.com/ObservedObserver/chatgpt-i18n) project. I've removed Vercel and the API, as well as the ability to use Azure. In exchange, I've added the capability to dynamically modify the chatgpt model. I've also incorporated the ability to support any JSON file format with a unique key and a key to be translated.

## Start

```sh
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Demo
